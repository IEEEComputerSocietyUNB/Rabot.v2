New version of a Telegram bot to help students with psychological/emotional issues
during their academic years on Universidade de Brasília (UnB)

This project is aimed at all students that suffer through their academic years and
might need more help than it's usually provided.

This bot is expected to run on Telegram using RASA api. It's development team is
composed of psychology, computer science and engineering students. The project
started in 2017 with various steps to improve the student's knowledge to be capable
of building a fully-fledged bot. Latest stable version is 2.0 on another repository.
Currently at version 3.0 beta, the bot has greatly changed it's architecture.

## Installing locally

Download this repository and go to it's folder

```shell
git clone {this repo}
cd {this repo}
```

Create a virtual environment, activate it and install it's requirements

Linux:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Windows:

```cmd
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Train the bot

`rasa train`

Run the bot on console

`rasa shell`

## Setting up telegram

Firstly, install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) and create an account, we'll use it later.

Now open your `credentials.yml` file and edit the `telegram` part with your information.

```yaml
telegram:
  access_token: "274838550:AbGD_z9Z3G3ZLGzBL3bxAQxf1NS7l54sLjJ"
  verify: "{your bot's name}"
  webhook_url: "https://{ngrok's url}/webhooks/telegram/webhook"
```

Your access token you can get via botFather (either creating a bot or request your bot's token).
The webhook url will be provided by ngrok once you run `ngrok http 5005`.

Be careful to not commit this part (mostly the access token). And when you do, change your
access token via botFather

# SlothBot

A simple bot that identifies information from
users and stores somewhere.

## Simple chat

This bot has been created for a specific use,
each branch consists of different
behaviours. An example is `bot/pet-lover`
that understands the following dialog:

>> Oi
> Olá, qual o seu nome?
>> Meu nome é fulano.
> Prazer, fulano, eu sou o SlothBot. Você
tem algum animal de estimação? Se sim, qual
o nome e a idade dele?
>> Eu tenho um gato chamado Gato e ele tem
122 anos.
> O que eu entendi é que você tem um gato
chamado Gato e ele tem 122 anos de idade.
É isso mesmo?
>> Sim.
> Que bom, meu serviço está feito!
>> Ok

The bot has to understand the person's name
and identify if a person has a pet, if the
person does have it, the bot must register
the pet's kind, name and age.
After that, he must check with the user if
the information is correct. If yes, then
the bot has done it's purpose, otherwise
it must request the user to repeat the
information.
